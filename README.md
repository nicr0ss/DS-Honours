### Pre-Analysis Plan

This should be completed after you have your data set but before you begin your analysis. **Make sure to timestamp this document!** This is the whole point of a Pre-Analysis Plan. It should contain the following sections:

| Section | Description |
|-----|-----|
| Abstract  | an abstract for your project, excl. findings  |
| Data  | description of your data set (something akin to a synthesis of the Step 1 assignment)  |
| Strategy  | an outline of the steps you will take to analyze your data (mostly a description of the code)  |
| Analysis  | any heuristics or mathematical models that you use, and the reasons for their use  |
| Deliverables  | a description of the deliverable files in the repo, incl. where your presentation is  |
| Sources   | list of sources for your data _and any other research_ that you did  |
